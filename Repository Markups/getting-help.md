# Getting help

When you have a problem while executing the code, or while implementing the similar problem, <b> you're not alone! </b>There are many
places to ask for help in.

## Websites to ask help on :

Personally, I've never asked a question on any of these sites. 

- [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) is a question/answer site
    for programmers. Search for your question first, maybe someone has
    already asked that and it has been answered.
- At the time of writing this,
    [The learnpython Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/)
    is another good place to ask Python questions on.
- [Quora](https://www.quora.com/) is one more resource where a programmer can get advice from an expert. It hosts informative content created and shared by its users.
